 * record parses or carries a resource sample. Before ANY state advance,
 * the completion claim is re-proven here against the exact deterministic
 * plan AND the exact SQLite rows/content of that cycle:
 * - an ambiguous abort record cannot prove its committed extent (fail
 *   closed); a non-aborted record must report the exact deterministic
 *   full-cycle totals, and every non-aborted actor identity of the
 *   deterministic stream must be recorded in operations.jsonl,
 * - SQLite must contain EXACTLY the deterministic rows of the recorded
 *   cycle (every id present with matching content, nothing extra,
 *   nothing partial) — state is never advanced from incomplete SQLite.
 * The cycle's resource sample is written by this recovery (in the live
 * loop it lands after the state checkpoint, so it cannot pre-exist in
 * this interruption window); any existing sample already passed the
 * strict JSONL history validation.
 *
 * After the proof, the cumulative counters are advanced from the RECORDED
 * totals (so state stays exactly consistent with the JSONL history),
 * tableRows come from the oracle rebuilt from SQLite, the resource sample
 * and completed marker are written, and nothing is re-executed — no
 * duplicate rows, no duplicate records, no double-counted work.
