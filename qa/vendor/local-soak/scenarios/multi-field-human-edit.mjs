/**
 * Scenario: a multi-field human edit raced against a public-API update.
 *
 * Hypothesis: a human edits 2+ fields of one row in a single atomic write
 * while the public API updates a DIFFERENT field of the same row. The worker
 * must apply all human field changes atomically (or as a consistent
 * observation) — it must NOT partially apply one field, silently lose one
 * field, or fabricate a false conflict. The scenario exposes partial field
 * application, multi-field CAS mismatch, and silent loss of one field.
 *
 * The race needs a live Sheets/observation seam plus the public EntityManager
 * fork, so it runs only in live mode; local mode records `skipped`.
