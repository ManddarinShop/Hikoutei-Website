/**
 * Resolves the ACTUAL public-authority winner of the race via BOUNDED

 * the PROVEN winner — never from an assumed/unproven human edit.
 *
 * Each poll acquires the shared oracle lock ONLY for the instant read (a
 * short critical section), so concurrent actors can overlap the sleeps
 * between polls. The field is compared to the two known candidates:
 *
 * - update race: field is the local value -> "local" won; field is the
 *   human value -> "human" won (proven by authority observation).
 * - delete race: the row is absent AND our delete provably committed
 *   (`localCommitted`) -> "delete" won; the row is present with the human
 *   value -> "human" won.
 *
 * The local transition has already settled (allSettled) before this runs, but
 * the direct human edit's projection is asynchronous, so a SINGLE read could
 * misclassify the winner before the human value lands — a delayed human value
 * that lands a moment after a premature "local" read is the exact race this
 * guard closes. The poll therefore requires the SAME observed winner across
 * `SCENARIO_RACE_WINNER_SETTLE_OBSERVATIONS` separated reads; if the observed
 * winner ever changes (local -> human as the delayed edit lands) the streak
 * resets and the later winner wins. If no single winner settles before the
 * deadline the caller records a truthful skip (never a premature local/delete
 * winner from one authority read). The oracle is reconciled ONLY once a
 * winner is settled (replace with the observed authority row, or delete), so
 * a transient early observation never mutates the oracle.

 * orphan id), is idempotent (removing a missing row is a no-op), and is
 * restart-safe. Never touches internal storage/outbox.
