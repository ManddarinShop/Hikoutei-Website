 * discarded or recorded as a conflict, the row is NEVER resurrected, and no
 * stale projection is left behind. The scenario exposes: a human edit that
 * resurrects a deleted row, a delete-aware baseline that mishandles the
 * identity shift, and a stale projection.
 *
 * The race needs a live Sheets/observation seam plus the public EntityManager
