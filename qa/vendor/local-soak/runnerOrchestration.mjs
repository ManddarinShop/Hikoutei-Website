/**
 * Local multi-table soak runner orchestration.
 *
 * Executes deterministic cycles against the CURRENT LOCAL BUILD of
 * Hikoutei through the public API only. Each cycle touches every active
 * table (create/update/delete prologue), runs forked actors with seeded
 * mixed operations, verifies sampled queries against the in-memory oracle,
 * probes human-edit/CAS convergence every 10th cycle in live mode, and
 * rescans plus close/reopens the runtime every 60th cycle.
 *
 * Determinism contract: every actor operation is planned UP FRONT in a
 * sequential planning pass against the deterministic post-prologue oracle
 * state, so the planned stream is a pure function of (seed, cycle) and
 * never of actor scheduling. Execution keeps the forked actors but
 * serializes each oracle-touching operation through one async mutex, so
 * every query is verified against the oracle state committed at the same
 * instant — scheduling can never produce false mismatches.
 *
 * Reliability contract: any exception escaping a cycle (live convergence,
 * full scan, reopen, artifact I/O) becomes a stable redacted abort record
 * that counts toward the failure budget; the run always writes its cycle/
 * state/summary artifacts, closes the runtime, and collects the log.
 *
 * Bounded recovery invariant: the filesystem and SQLite cannot be one
 * transaction, so a process interruption at ANY point between them is
 * repaired by the resume path with idempotent, checkpointed recovery —
 * never by silently starting fresh. The durable order is: atomic
 * in-flight marker -> cycle SQLite work -> cycle record -> ATOMIC state
 * checkpoint -> resource sample -> atomic completed marker. Every resume
 * validates BOTH state.json and checkpoint.json, then verifies the
 * authority's EXACT row sets (ids AND content) against a deterministic
 * replay of the stored seed/params before trusting SQLite (rebuilt into
 * the oracle): checkpointed cycles must match exactly, an interrupted
 * cycle is bounded to its own deterministic planned rows — including the
 * exact committed-stage candidates of each planned actor op, so a
 * two-flush forkIsolation row caught between its flushes is a valid
 * interrupted stage — with sequential prologue stage rules, and any
 * abort cycle whose committed extent cannot be proven fails closed.
 *
 * HIGH 1: a recorded cycle ahead of state.lastCompletedCycle is NEVER
 * trusted merely because its JSONL record parses or carries a resource
 * sample — before completeRecordedCycle() advances state, the cycle is
 * re-proven against the exact deterministic plan (record totals plus the
 * full non-aborted actor identity grid) AND the exact SQLite rows/content
 * of that cycle; a missing, tampered, or partial row fails closed instead
 * of advancing from incomplete SQLite.
 *
 * HIGH 2: every recovery expectation and plan derives from the stored
 * seed/params and the deterministic generator ALONE (a pure replay
 * planner), never from whatever partial rows SQLite currently holds —
 * including a zero-cycle run (lastCompletedCycle 0) interrupted during
 * its first cycle. SQLite is only ever CHECKED against the independently
 * derived expected state (execution mirror), never used to change the
 * plan. The ONE deliberate exception is the DB-backed probe evidence:
 * an ok probe record is trusted for the replay oracle mutation only when
 * the authority contains the deterministic human-edit value for that
 * exact cycle/table/field, so a forged ok probe (adjusted counters,
 * unchanged DB) fails closed instead of mutating the replay or passing
 * the exact proof.
 *
 * MEDIUM 4: before the runtime opens, a resume inspects the EXISTING
 * SQLite schema read-only and fails when an expected entity table or
 * column is missing — a dropped table/column is never silently recreated
 * by the runtime's non-destructive migration and then accepted with zero
 * rows.
 *
 * HIGH 3: a FRESH run removes the prior state.json/checkpoint.json (with
 * the other runner-owned artifacts) BEFORE opening the new DB/runtime, so
 * a crash after the new DB opens but before the first state write can
 * never resume the previous run's identity or zero-cycle state — --resume
 * fails cleanly instead.
 *
 * The JSONL history is bound to the same replay (identity, kind, and
 * table of every record), the interrupted cycle's deterministic
 * mutations are reconciled idempotently (deduping cycle/operation/
 * resource records), and a redacted recovery reason is persisted. Each
 * interruption boundary either recovers deterministically or fails
 * safely before any runtime opens; a corrupt/partial state write can
 * never silently restart a run as if it were fresh.
 *
 * Mutation path: public `createTypedSheets()` / EntityManager only. The
 * direct Sheets client is used exclusively for test-only observation, the
 * simulated human edit probe, and cleanup.
