/**
 * Closes one runtime with a final second attempt on failure.
 *
 * A runtime that fails to close is never silently discarded: the first
 * failure triggers one final close attempt. Because Hikoutei close() is
 * retryable (a failed close leaves the runtime open), the retry genuinely
 * re-runs the provider cleanup instead of no-oping — a real first-attempt
 * close failure can therefore recover, and only a persistent failure is
 * returned so the caller records a stable cleanup failure and forces the
 * summary to failed.
 *
 * Failure tracking uses a BOOLEAN flag, never `error !== undefined`: a
 * close that rejects with a non-Error value (a hook or provider that
 * throws `undefined`) is still a FAILED close and is reported as such —
 * it must never masquerade as a successful close. When the thrown value
 * is not an Error, a stable synthetic Error is returned so every caller
 * can branch on `error !== undefined` without losing the failure.
 *
 * Test injection (`__test*` options): with `failClose`, the FIRST attempt
 * fails before the real close runs (a simulated provider cleanup failure)
 * and the final retry genuinely invokes the runtime close, so a run can
 * recover. With `failClosePersistent`, the first attempt fails before the
 * real close AND the retry — which genuinely ran the provider cleanup —
 * still reports failure, so a persistent close failure keeps failing the
 * run. `failClose` mirrors `__testCloseFail`; `failClosePersistent` mirrors
 * `__testCloseFailPersistent` and `__testFailReplacementClose`.
 *
 * @param {{ close(): Promise<unknown> }} runtime
 * @param {{ failClose?: boolean, failClosePersistent?: boolean }} [options]
 * @returns {Promise<Error | undefined>} the close error when both
 *   attempts failed, or `undefined` when a close succeeded.
